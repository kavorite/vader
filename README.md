A port of [cjhutto/vaderSentiment][ascendant] to Go, and assorted API ancillary
to that end. Thanks to [cjhutto], and to [ckw017] for their work [porting VADER
to a statically-typed language ahead of me,][sister] which made this work
somewhat easier to approach. See the resulting implementation run on the
upstream demo texts and a brief usage example [here][demo].
